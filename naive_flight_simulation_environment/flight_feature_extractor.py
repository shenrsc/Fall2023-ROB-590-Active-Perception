        Almost the same as CombinedExtractor but changed a little bit to suite our environment and good for debug
        Combined features extractor for Dict observation spaces.
        Builds a features extractor for each key of the space. Input from each space
        is fed through a separate submodule (CNN or MLP, depending on input shape),
        the output features are concatenated and fed through additional MLP network ("combined").

        :param cnn_output_dim: Number of features to output from each CNN submodule(s). Defaults to
            256 to avoid exploding network sizes.
        :param normalized_image: Whether to assume that the image is already normalized
            or not (this disables dtype and bounds checks): when True, it only checks that
            the space is a Box and has 3 dimensions.
            Otherwise, it checks that it has expected dtype (uint8) and bounds (values in [0, 255]).
